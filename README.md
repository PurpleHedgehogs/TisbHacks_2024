Detecting and Diagnosing Pneumonia

Our AI will help assist doctors in correctly assessing patients' X-rays by overlooking any possible diseases and misdiagnoses.

Problem Statement: 
Doctors examine x-rays of a person to diagnose which has a chance of minor errors or overlooking other diseases. 
795,000 amount of people are incorrectly diagnosed or missed in diagnosing at the early stages just in America. 
This may lead the patient to misunderstand what they are diagnosed with and unknowingly harm themselves

Mission Statment:
Our mission is to create an AI that can identify all possible diseases in a person just by looking at an X-ray. 
We have to take up only the identification of pneumonia in the thorax. We can improve efficiency by using computer models powered by AI and ML. 
This will help doctors back up their decisions and even prevent plausible dangers at an early stage.

Solution:
We have implemented datasets including various pictures of healthy lungs and lungs containing pneumonia. 
As we feed more examples into the system, it will eventually learn the difference between the two, just like a real doctor.

1. We imported all the libraries required to make our code
2. Later, we uploaded the the files from our Kaggle dataset into the jupyter notebook
3. We plotted the graphs with the help of AI for us, as users, to understand the statistics of our code
4. We declared variables for not only the images, but for also the training process and model
5. Then, we printed the pictures from our datasets to ensure that the parameter, like dimensions and labels, are correct
6. We created a model, while carefully choosing the right layers and corresponding values
7. We used 10 epochs to have the AI read the data plenty of times to increase the accuracy and precision
8. We began to predict the accuracy and print it out(98.4% accuracy)
9. We tested our code by using images from the internet and checked whether we got correct results or not
